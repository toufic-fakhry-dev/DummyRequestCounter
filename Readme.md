# DummyRequestCounter

## 🧠 Overview
This project is a simple multi-container application using **Flask** (Python) and **Redis**.  
Every time you open the main page, the app increments and displays a counter stored in Redis.

## 🚀 How to Run the Application

### 1️⃣ Build and Start Containers
```bash
docker compose up --build
```

### 2️⃣ Access the Application
Open your browser and visit:  
👉 **http://127.0.0.1:8000**

Each refresh increments the counter stored in Redis.

---

## 🗄 Persistent Storage (Volume)

To make sure the Redis data is not lost when containers stop or restart, a **named volume** was added in `docker-compose.yml`.

```yaml
volumes:
  redis_data:
```

Inside the Redis service:
```yaml
volumes:
  - redis_data:/data
command: ["redis-server", "--appendonly", "yes"]
```

This allows Redis to store its data on disk and automatically reload it when the container restarts.

You can verify the volume:
```bash
docker volume ls
```

---

## 🌐 Custom Network

A custom bridge network called **dummy_network** was created to handle communication between the containers.

```yaml
networks:
  dummy_network:
    driver: bridge
```

Both services use this network:
```yaml
networks:
  - dummy_network
```

You can verify the network and see which containers are attached to it:
```bash
docker network ls
docker network inspect dummyrequestcounter_dummy_network
```

---

## 🧪 Verify Everything Works

1. Run the containers:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```
2. Visit **http://127.0.0.1:8000**
3. Check Redis data:
   ```bash
   docker compose exec redis redis-cli GET hits
   ```
4. Stop and restart containers — the counter should persist:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d
   ```

---

## 🧰 Troubleshooting and Debugging

To view container logs:
```bash
docker compose logs
```

To run commands inside a container:
```bash
docker compose exec api sh
docker compose exec redis redis-cli
```

---

## 🧹 Cleanup

To stop and remove containers, networks, and volumes:
```bash
docker compose down -v
```

---

## ✅ Summary
- The Flask API and Redis services are containerized and orchestrated with Docker Compose.  
- Redis data is now **persistent** thanks to the named volume `redis_data`.  
- A **custom bridge network (`dummy_network`)** enables secure communication between both containers.  
- The application runs correctly on **http://127.0.0.1:8000** and keeps track of visits even after restarts.  
- Docker commands and configurations are documented for easy reuse and debugging.
